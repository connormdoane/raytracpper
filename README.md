# RayTrac$`^{++}`$er

A (somewhat) simple raytracer built in C++

A few years ago I built a raytracer in Rust as an exercise in both the language and the concepts of a raytracer. Looking back on it, it's very sloppy, and as I've taken more interest in computer graphics I've wanted to redo the project with a fresh perspective in a language I'm more confident in. This is that project.
